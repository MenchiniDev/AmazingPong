# AmazingPong

Hi!
here you can find one of my first projects in c++,
basically what this program does is simulate a game like Pong but between 2 different types of players the first one (the 'X' one) can predict the trajectory of the ball and move itself to capture it and thus save the result; 
the other (the 'O' one) is simply implemented using the Y coordinates of the ball, making its future movements easy to understand.
to start the simulation, you have to enter a command w a s d, which gives the starting direction to the ball, then all the game will continue alone forever.hope you like this simulation, it's not much but I really enjoyed building the prediction method used by the first player and I wanted to share it with everyone <3.
if you have any inquiries, please contact me at lorenzomenchini42@gmail.com

new features on the way, with more types of old games played on the itseft pc!
