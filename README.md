# AmazingPong

hi!
here u can find one of my first projects in c++, basically what this program does is simulating a game like Pong but between 2 differents type of players
the first (the 'X' one) can predict the trajectory of the ball and move himself to catch it and so save the result;
the other (the 'O' one) is simply implemented using the Y coordinates of the ball, making her future movements easy to understand
to start the simulation, you have to enter a command w a s d, that gives the start direction to the ball, later all the game will continue by itself forever.
hope u will enjoy this simulation, its not that much but i really enjoyed building the prediction metod used by the first player,
and i wanted to share it with everyone <3
if u have any request, just contact me at lorenzomenchini42@gmail.com
